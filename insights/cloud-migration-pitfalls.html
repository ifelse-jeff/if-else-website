  <h1>Migrating From On-Prem to Cloud: Avoid These 3 Pitfalls</h1>
  <p>Cloud migration can accelerate your business — but only if you avoid the common pitfalls that derail projects and drive up costs. Here are three key areas to focus on:</p>

  <h2>1. Failing to Plan for Architecture and Dependencies</h2>
  <p>Moving workloads as-is (lift-and-shift) often leads to higher costs and performance issues. Take time to assess dependencies between applications and design a cloud architecture that aligns with business needs.</p>

  <h2>2. Overlooking Security and Compliance</h2>
  <p>Cloud environments require a new security model. Misconfigured access controls, unencrypted data, and poor monitoring practices are leading causes of cloud breaches. Build security and compliance into your migration roadmap from day one.</p>

  <h2>3. Not Managing Cloud Costs</h2>
  <p>Cloud services are billed on consumption. Without cost governance, expenses can quickly spiral out of control. Use tagging, budgets, and auto-scaling to keep costs predictable and under control.</p>

  <p>Cloud migration is not just about technology — it's about people and process too. Align your teams, educate stakeholders, and document every step for a smoother journey.</p>
